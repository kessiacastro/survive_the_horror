# Survive The Horror

Just a small 2D game in Ruby using [Gosu](https://www.libgosu.org) for the Introduction to Programming course in 2014.

```
brew install sdl2
rbenv install ruby # Check if the newer version of ruby is in rbenv global, if not: rbenv global 2.3.3
gem install rubygems-update
gem install gosu

ruby prin.rb # To run the game
```


Thanks to [Chris Hildenbrand](http://www.2dgameartguru.com/) for the 2D arts that we made using his tutorials.
